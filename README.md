# CityscapesSemSegSanFranciscoLombard
Training in Cityscapes dataset, implement semantic segmentation to detect objects like trees, buildings, roads, sky, cars, pedestrians, bicycles, stop signs, and traffic lights. 

Just finished generating semantic segmentation videos for the first time, but I will improve on the training of the dataset.

I generated semantic segmentation images in segmented_imgs directory.  They look like paintings from a postcard.
Notice the road has been classified in LomardSegmentedImg4.JPG and LomardSegmentedImg5.JPG.
